Your computer needs internet connection to display the maps and the icons (i.e. menu icon, etc.) on the website.

===================================================================================

If your computer does not have an active internet connection, follow the steps below to view the icons:

1. Open the "style.css" file in the root folder (i.e. "codesnippet/").
2. Uncomment line 3 and line 4 in the "style.css" file.
3. Save the file.

===================================================================================
NOTE: You have to comment line 3 and line 4 out (or delete them) before you host the website on an online server
===================================================================================
NOTE: You should delete the "fa" folder in "codesnippet/css/" before you host the website on an online server

Enjoy!
Thank you!
